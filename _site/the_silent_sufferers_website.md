        In our Multimedia lab class, our group of four embarked on a compelling campaign project centered around a social cause that resonated deeply with us. Our mission was to raise awareness about the devastating impact of plastic pollution on sea turtles residing in the Pacific Ocean. Our campaign, aptly named "The Silent Sufferers," aims to shed light on this pressing issue. Each member of our group took on a specific role to contribute to the campaign's success. One team member created a social media account to amplify our message. Another member focused on typography, crafting impactful visuals that captured the essence of our campaign. Meanwhile, another team member dedicated their expertise to graphic design, meticulously crafting a captivating logo and poster. As for myself, I took on the responsibility of designing and developing a responsive campaign website. Additionally, I oversaw the creation of a Spreadshop site, which would serve as an avenue to sell merchandise and further support a non-profit we picked in which are proceeds will go to. Our campaign website serves as an informational hub for visitors, offering insights into why and how we are striving to help sea turtles. We provide resources that highlight the detrimental effects of plastic on these majestic creatures. Moreover, we have a dedicated section showcasing the merchandise available for purchase on our Spreadshop page. For the website, I leveraged my skills and tools to deliver an engaging user experience. Using Figma, I meticulously designed a wireframe that mapped out the structure and layout of our website. With the help of Codespaces on GitHub, I translated the design into reality, employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring our website to life.
