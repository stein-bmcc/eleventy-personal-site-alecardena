        In our Multimedia lab class, our group of four created a campaign project for a social cause we felt passionate about.  Our social cause was to raise awareness about the harmful impact of plastic pollution on Pacific Ocean sea turtles. Our campaign, "The Silent Sufferers," tackles this issue head-on. Each member of our group took on a specific role to contribute to the campaign's success. One team member created a social media account to amplify our message, while another focused on designing an impactful poster for our campaign. A talented graphic designer/branding illustrator ensured our campaign visuals were striking and cohesive. As for myself, I took charge of designing and developing our campaign website and also created a Spreadshop page for merchandise. Our campaign website serves as an informative platform, enlightening visitors about our mission to protect sea turtles and the detrimental effects of plastic pollution on their well-being. Additionally, we showcase select merchandise from our Spreadshop page, allowing supporters to contribute while displaying their support. Using Figma, I created a wireframe to plan the website's layout and design. Then, utilizing GitHub Codespaces, I coded the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Finally, I uploaded my GitHub Codespaces to Netlify, making the website accessible to all. You can view our website and wireframe by clicking the links below.
