        As part of a dynamic class group project, we were challenged to create a comprehensive 
        business model, ad, storyboard, wireframe, and mock-up for a cutting-edge streaming 
        service. After careful consideration, we decided to develop an affordable music-streaming 
        website that would appeal to a wide range of users. I was responsible for creating the 
        wireframes and mock-ups, utilizing Figma to bring my ideas to life. To ensure the highest 
        level of quality and attention to detail, I also used Photoshop to edit some of the images, 
        resulting in a visually stunning and user-friendly website that would provide a seamless 
        music-streaming experience for our target audience. Overall, this project allowed me to 
        strengthen my design skills and collaborate effectively within a team to bring our collective 
        vision to fruition.
