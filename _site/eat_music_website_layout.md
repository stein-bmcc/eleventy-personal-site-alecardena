        Figma, Adobe Photoshop

        For this project, I was part of a group tasked with creating a business model, ad, storyboard,
        wireframe, and mock-up for a streaming service. We chose to create an affordable music-streaming
        website. I was in charge of creating the wireframes and mock-ups. I used Figma to do so. I also
        used Photoshop to edit some of the images.
