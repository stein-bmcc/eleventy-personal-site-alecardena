    For my web design class, I designed and developed a two-page website about 
    the "Star Wars: Andor" series that I love. The website aims to provide a 
    clear and comprehensive home page and episodes' guide for fans of the show. 
    To achieve this, I first prototyped the layout using Figma and then translated 
    it into a functional web page using HTML, CSS, and JS with Atom. The design 
    and layout were carefully thought out to enhance the user experience and create 
    an immersive environment for fans of the show. Click on the link below to see 
    the working website.
