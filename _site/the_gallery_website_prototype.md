        In my Multimedia class, I designed a user interface for an e-commerce art website called 
        "The Gallery" using Figma. My concept was to create a platform where people can purchase 
        a diverse range of artworks including pottery, posters, paintings, and more. The website 
        also features artists’ portfolios and interactive features to connect customers with the 
        artists. I created a comprehensive project proposal outlining the development process and 
        created a prototype, wireframe, and site map using Figma. Click on the link below to see 
        the complete design and layout.
