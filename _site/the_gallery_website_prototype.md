        Created a UI outline of an e-commerce art website using Figma. The concept for “The Gallery” 
        website - which I came up with - is to provide a digital space where people can buy a variety 
        of artworks - such as pottery, posters, paintings etc.It also allows the customer to see the 
        artists’ portfolio and to interact with them. I created a prototype with Figma, as well as a 
        project proposal outlining the concept and development process. Below is a link to the figma 
        that has a prototype, wireframe, and site map
    </p>
