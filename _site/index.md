  <h2>Bio:</h2>

  <p>
    Hello there! I'm Alejandro Cardena, a New York City native and a first-generation college student. 
    Aspiring to be a UX designer/Front-end developer, I am passionate about designing user-friendly 
    interfaces that enhance the user experience. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and stay 
    up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies. I believe that design is not just about 
    aesthetics, but also about creating products that solve real-world problems and make a positive 
    impact on people's lives. Let's connect and collaborate to create something amazing!
  </p>

  <h2>Experience & Skills:</h2>

  <p>
    Throughout my creative journey, I have honed my skills in various software and coding languages. I have 
    a deep understanding of the Adobe Suite and have utilized it to produce captivating photomontages, 
    illustrations, magazine spreads, and posters. Additionally, I have demonstrated proficiency in website 
    creation using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. I have also explored the world of animation, utilizing 
    programs such as Animate, After Effects, and Cinema 4D to bring my ideas to life. My diverse skill set 
    enables me to approach each project with a unique perspective and to craft memorable visuals and experiences.
