        In my Web Design class, I created a responsive website for CUNY Design, which aims to 
        inform visitors about the various Design-related programs offered by the City University 
        of New York. Using Figma, I designed the website's layout and then coded it in Atom, 
        ensuring it was optimized for multiple devices. To enhance the website's visual appeal, 
        I used Photoshop to edit images. The website provides an easy-to-navigate platform for 
        users to learn about the different programs, their requirements, and outcomes. Click on 
        the link below to view the website.
