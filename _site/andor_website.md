  <p>
    For my web design class, I created a website dedicated to the "Andor" series that 
    I love. The website aims to provide a clear and comprehensive About page and Episodes' 
    guide for fans of the show. To achieve this, I first prototyped the layout using Figma 
    and then translated it into a functional web page using HTML, CSS, and JS with Atom. 
    The design and layout were carefully thought out to enhance the user experience and 
    create an immersive environment for fans of the show. Check out the link below to see 
    the working website.
