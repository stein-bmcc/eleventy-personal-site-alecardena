        I created this space-themed poster using a combination of Photoshop techniques. 
        The poster features seven different images: a background, five different planets, 
        and a space shuttle. I arranged the images in a position that I felt would look 
        visually appealing. My goal was to create a comic-themed poster, and I achieved 
        this by separating each image I wanted to use from its original image, creating a 
        layer of what I selected, and converting each image into a smart object. Then, I 
        used a poster edge filter, lowered the threshold of each image, and applied the 
        stylized filter with a touch of oil paint. I adjusted the contrast, surface blur, 
        and applied the cutout filter to each image before increasing its saturation. To 
        finish off the poster, I chose the Broadway font, which I felt was ideal for decorative 
        posters and display material. The result is a visually stunning space-themed poster 
        that would be perfect for any space lover.
