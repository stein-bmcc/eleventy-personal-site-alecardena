        For this project in my animation class, I was tasked with creating a 2D character animation 
        using Adobe Animate. I decided to create an original character design and story to bring to 
        life. After completing the animation, I used Audacity to create a custom soundtrack that 
        complemented the animation's visuals and mood. The final product was a cohesive and engaging 
        animation that showcased my skills in both design and sound production.
