        For this project in my Multimedia class, I designed a magazine cover and spread featuring 
        an upcoming Star Wars game. Using InDesign and Photoshop, I carefully selected and edited 
        images to perfectly capture the essence of the game. The color scheme I chose reflects the 
        futuristic and sci-fi themes of the game, while the font I used for the main header in the 
        spread adds to the overall aesthetic. I combined the text and images seamlessly in InDesign, 
        resulting in a visually appealing and cohesive layout.
